While the main topic of this research was the development of a query analysis tool for multi-domain queries, several tools were developed and used on the side in order to support the research. In order to gather and analyze data in the form of natural language questions, two tools were developed, to filter and process the data. In addition, two external parsers were evaluated in order to find an optimal strategy.
