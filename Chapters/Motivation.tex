Over the years, great advances have been made in the fields of search and information retrieval. A lot of attention has been brought over the topics of full-text search or document indexing. This great deal of effort has brought upon us tools, such as Google, Yahoo, that allow us to retrieve any document available on the web that might be related to a topic we are searching for. This has had great repercussions upon the world, democratizing and easing the access to information all over the world. However, as we depend more and more upon this type of simple but wide search, we have reached the limits of such a system. It is not documents we are now looking for, but precise answers to questions. It is no longer sufficient to give the user a list of documents that he has to read in order to possibly find an answer. We now need to give the user a proper and actionable answer.

Slow progress has been made in that field, and several projects have implemented some question answering applied to one restricted field or situation, where factual information is available and the input domain is restricted enough to narrow the question down to one possible answer. What is now needed are improvement in two areas: first, the single-domain restriction must be lifted, as question might span more than one domain(e.g. Who was the president of italy the year the man first went to the moon); secondly, a next-generation search engine should be able to provide results for not only questions about precise facts, but also about what we can name judgement calls, questions where many options can be narrowed down and offered according to a precise ranking (e.g. Where can I find a cheap Chinese restaurant in Milan).

The proliferation of open and accessible web services has allowed the world to access, aggregate and mix data in previously unthought ways. This has led a team at Politecnico di Milano to undertake the effort of building a system that pushes the boundaries presented in the previous paragraph. This system called SeCo is under active development and shall be described further in this document.

In particular, while much progress has been made on the front of the theoretical and formal as well as engineering aspects of distributing a multi-domain query over a series of services, merging back the results in a consistent and interesting manner, there is still a great need for exploration in the subject of interfacing these advances with the user in the most natural and organic fashion possible. Traditionally, such interfaces consist either of a application where the parameters need to be set manually and exhaustively, or a formal syntax that is both strict and cumbersome. Services such as Google or Yahoo! having popularized and democratized the simple input box where free text can be entered, the users now expect more liberty and for the computer to have the burden of understanding the meaning of their sentence. This is what lead us to the current project of research in the field of query analysis, specifically oriented towards understand and translating the queries made in the SeCo project and that can span more than one domain.
